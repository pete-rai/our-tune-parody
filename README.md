This app generates a parody Radio One "[Our Tune](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Our_Tune)" style narration with the iconic background music of Nino Rota's [Romeo and Juliet theme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romeo_and_Juliet_(1968_film_soundtrack)) and a cloned voice of the inimitable [Simon Bates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_Bates).

Back in the far-off days of 1980s radio, before podcasts and streaming, we didn't realise it was something of a golden age. One voice, one story, one piece of music - and the whole nation would stop what they were doing to listen. This project is a light-hearted tribute to those bygone days.

Shout out to the [Chatterbox](https://github.com/resemble-ai/chatterbox) team, whose great work made the voice cloning side of this possible.

## License

This application is available under [the MIT license](https://github.com/pete-rai/our-tune-parody/blob/main/LICENSE). _Please respect the terms of the license._ This software is released with the [karmaware](https://pete-rai.github.io/karmaware) tag

## Ethics

- This project is meant for fun, parody, creative or educational use.
- Please don't use it to do bad things or to hurt anyone.
- Be kind, be sensible, and enjoy making your own tragic love stories sound epic.

## Content

- **`bates.wav`** - a short voice sample used as the cloning prompt.
- **`music.wav`** - background music (Nino Rota's *Romeo and Juliet* theme).
- **`titanic.mp3`** - a generated sample output (Jack & Rose's tragic tale).
- **`main.py`** - the script that generates the parody narration.

## Installation

First clone this repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pete-rai/our-tune-parody.git
cd our-tune-parody
```

Next it's best to create a virtual environment to avoid polluting your global Python setup:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # On Linux / macOS
venv\Scripts\activate      # On Windows PowerShell
```

Then you need to install the requirements - which _must be done in the order below_. This order is used to resolve a version clash between PyTorch, Chatter and CUDA. You will see some dependency errors at the end, which you can safely ignore.

```bash
pip install ffmpeg-python soundfile
pip install chatterbox-tts
pip install torch==2.5.1+cu121 torchaudio==2.5.1+cu121 --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121
````

The requirements shown here assume you have a CUDA compatible GPU. If you are restricted to a CPU, then remove the `+cu121` text from the last line in the requirements:

```bash
pip install torch==2.5.1 torchaudio==2.5.1 --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121
````

Also change the model instantiation line in `main.py`:

```python
MODEL = ChatterboxTTS.from_pretrained(device = "cpu")  # this says "cuda" by default
```

Please note that the CPU mode is untested.

## Usage

Run the script to generate your own Our Tune style MP3:

```bash
python main.py
```

The very first time you run this, it can be a bit slow. However, it will be faster in subsequent runs. The output will be saved to `our-tune.mp3`.

You will, of course, want to edit the narration text to be your own tragic love story. This text is stored inside `main.py` in the `TRANSCRIPT` list:

```python
TRANSCRIPT = [
    "In the spring of 1912, on the ship they called unsinkable, Rose was a girl trapped in a life of wealth, rules and duty."
    "Then came Jack â€” a boy with no fortune, just a sketchbook, and a way of looking at her that made her feel truly alive.",
    ...
]
```

Each list item is a speech block. For easy reading of the code, some strings are on different lines - but these will be joined into one single string by Python. Whereas some strings are specifically separated by commas. This is important, as separated strings will have an audio pause between them, which can be used for dramatic effect.

Keep each block short and concise. The chatter model does not work well with long and verbose text.

Use punctuation to control the audio, don't worry about the grammar. Full stops, commas, dashes and ellipses can be used for short pauses. Separate sentence strings generate long pauses.

Have fun!
