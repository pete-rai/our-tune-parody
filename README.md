# Our Tune Parody Generator

This app generates a parody Radio One "[Our Tune](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Our_Tune)" style narration with the iconic background music of Nino Rota's [Romeo and Juliet theme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romeo_and_Juliet_(1968_film_soundtrack)) and a cloned voice of the inimitable [Simon Bates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_Bates).

Back in the far-off days of 1980s radio, before podcasts and streaming, we didn't realise it was something of a golden age. One voice, one story, one piece of music - and the whole nation would stop what they were doing to listen. This project is a light-hearted tribute to those bygone days.

Click [here](https://github.com/pete-rai/our-tune-parody/titanic.mp3) to listen to a sample Our Tune generated by this app.

## Ethics

- This project is meant for fun, parody, creative or educational use.
- Please don't use it to do bad things or to hurt anyone.
- Be kind, be sensible, and enjoy making your own tragic love stories sound epic.

## Content

- **`bates.wav`** - a short voice sample used as the cloning prompt.
- **`music.wav`** - background music (Nino Rota's *Romeo and Juliet* theme).
- **`titanic.mp3`** - a generated sample output (Jack & Rose's tragic tale).
- **`main.py`** - the script that generates the parody narration.

## Installation

First clone this repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pete-rai/our-tune-parody.git
cd our-tune-parody
```

Next it's best to create a virtual environment to avoid polluting your global Python setup:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # On Linux / macOS
venv\Scripts\activate      # On Windows PowerShell
```

Then install the requirements:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt --no-deps
````

### GPU vs CPU (PyTorch)

The `requirements.txt` file pins PyTorch as:

```bash
torch==2.5.1
```

This will install the correct build for your system.

* On a machine **without an NVIDIA GPU**, it will install the CPU-only build.
* On a machine **with a GPU**, pip will usually fetch the CUDA-enabled wheel.

If you want to be explicit and use CUDA 12.1 (as tested here):

```bash
pip install torch==2.5.1+cu121
```

## Usage

Run the script to generate your own Our Tune style MP3:

```bash
python main.py
```

The output will be saved as `our-tune.mp3`, blending the cloned narration with the music.

You will, of course, first want to edit the narration text to be your own tragic love story.

This text is stored inside `main.py` in the `TRANSCRIPT` list:

```python
TRANSCRIPT = [
    # keep your blocks short – use punctuation for pauses, not grammar
    "In the spring of 1912, on the ship they called unsinkable, Rose was a girl trapped in a life of wealth, rules and duty."
    "Then came Jack — a boy with no fortune, just a sketchbook, and a way of looking at her that made her feel truly alive.",
    ...
]
```

Each list item is a speech block. For easy reading of the code, some strings are on different lines but will be joined into one string by Python. Whereas some string are specifically separated by commas. This is important as separated strings have an audio pause between them, which can be used for dramatic effect.

Use punctuation to control the audio, don't worry about the grammar. Full stops, commas, dashes and ellipses can be used for short pauses. Separate sentence strings generate long pauses.

Have fun!
